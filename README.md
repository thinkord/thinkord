# Thinkord
<!-- <img src="./app/asset/thinkord.png" width="600"> -->

Thinkord is an open-source Electron application dedicated to helping people take notes easily and quickly.

We believe Thinkord can transform how people do note-taking by **focusing on capturing their thoughts rather than editing them**.

Hope you find this application helpful. If you are interested in developing Thinkord with us, please follow this [contribution guideline](#contributing).
